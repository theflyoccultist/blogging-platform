Phase 1: Initial Setup

    Set up the Blog Platform (Separate Project)
        ✔Create a new React project for the blog platform.
        ✔Set up the backend with Node.js and Express (or your preferred framework).
        ✔Install necessary dependencies (React, Express, Sequelize/TypeORM for PostgreSQL, etc.).
        ✔structure the project folder.

    Design Database Schema
        ✔Create a table for blog posts (id, title, content, author, timestamps).
        ✔Create a table for metadata (optional: tags, categories).
        Plan for potential future tables (e.g., analytics, comments).
        ✔Create User Model (username, password)
        ✔Connect to database from 'server.ts'
            psql -U postgres
            CREATE DATABASE blogging;
            \l
            \c blogging


    Implement CRUD API for Blog Posts backend /controllers folder
        ✔Create: Set up API endpoint for creating new blog posts (POST request).
        ✔Read: Set up API endpoint for fetching blog posts (GET request).
        ✔Update: Set up API endpoint for editing existing blog posts (PUT request).
        ✔Delete: Set up API endpoint for deleting blog posts (DELETE request).
        ✔Add user authentication to protect the endpoints (JWT or session-based).

        Implement CRUD API for tags

    Set up the Portfolio Integration
        Add a /blog endpoint in your portfolio project that fetches posts from the blog API.
        Implement frontend components to display blog posts (list view, post detail view).

Phase 2: Admin Features

    Create Admin Interface for Blog Platform
        Add a hidden admin route (e.g., /admin/blog) that’s protected by authentication.
        Implement a simple interface for creating, 
        editing, and deleting blog posts.
        ✔Make the admin interface accessible only to authenticated users.

    Frontend Enhancements
        Add pagination or lazy loading for the blog post list.
        Add a search or filtering feature for blog posts on the public side.
        Implement a rich text editor for writing blog posts (e.g., using react-quill).

Phase 3: Performance & SEO

    Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
        Implement code splitting and lazy loading for the blog management components.
        Optimize images and static resources for faster loading times.
    SEO & Social Media Integration
        Add metadata (title, description) and Open Graph tags for each blog post.
        Create an RSS feed for the blog posts to improve discoverability.

Phase 4: Analytics & Future Features

    Implement Analytics (Later Phase)
        Set up a system to track page views, most-read posts, etc.
        Consider third-party analytics services or build your own using PostgreSQL.

    Potential Future Features
        Implement comments or likes system.
        Add a tags or categories system for posts.
        Consider static site generation for the blog posts to improve SEO.

Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

    Testing
        ✔Write unit and integration tests for the API endpoints.
        Perform user testing on the admin interface.
    Deploy
        Deploy the blog platform separately from the portfolio.
        Ensure that the /blog endpoint on your portfolio correctly fetches posts from the live API.
